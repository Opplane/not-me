# U-Knot-Me

> Easy and type-safe validation

## Features:

- Planned out to be used and shared **between backend and frontend**
- **Powerful type inference**: no need to write types manually. Even _Discriminated Union types_ are guessed from your schemas.
  - Example of a _Discriminated Union Type_:
  ```typescript
  type UnionType =
    | {
        discriminator: "has-a";
        a: string;
      }
    | {
        discriminator: "has-b";
        b: boolean;
      };
  ```
- Simple **DSL-like** API
- **Implementation that is easy to read and change**, so you can fork it and extend it without much hassle.
- **No need for _try/catches_**: the final result will always be returned as the transformed input, or a tree of error messages
